QuantumWiki is an interactive encyclopedia designed to make quantum physics accessible and engaging. Rather than teaching through long-form chapters, we focus on the power of the individual equation. Each entry features an interactive visualization, the history of the scientist behind the discovery, and a look at how that math shapes our world today. Dive into the logic of the subatomic world, one equation at a time.
